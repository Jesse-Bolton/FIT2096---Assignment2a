Author's saying:
It's a bad year. I have lost 2 assignments without saving in a semester. How horrible!
I know I did bad in previous assignments, so this time I put lots and lots of effort in it, hoping i can pass the hurdle.
This is the last assignment of this unit. I want to pass this unit very much, but I submitted late due to my lost work.
I love to design games, i love game design and development. This unit is very helpful because I've learned a lot in this unit.
Thanks Jason for his hard working and kindness.
